Logo Ideas for FBI: Field Bug Interceptors


FBI Font =>
Use a bold, serif font for the "FBI" letters to give it an official, secret-agent vibe.


Field =>
Incorporate a stylized garden background (maybe some grass, leaves, and flowers) for the "Field" part.


Bug Interceptors =>
Add bugs (e.g., beetles, flies, ants) in a minimalist, sleek style around the text, almost like theyâ€™re being intercepted by something.
Maybe a bug net in action, or laser beams targeting bugs to give that "interceptor" feel.


Color Palette=>
Green & Earthy tones: Representing the garden field.
Black & White: For the FBI secret agent look.
Red or Yellow: Accentuate action or danger, like laser beams, or a "warning" effect on bugs.
